My name is Ayman, I am a cybersecurity graduate from RIT and aspirant security researcher. I am mostly passionate about reverse engineering, malware analysis, and exploit development. I am also interested in web security and red teaming / pentesting.

I also dabble in some programming to automate my tasks and write some tools. Other than that, I enjoy CTFs (Capture The Flag) competitions, where I can apply my skills in a fun and challenging way. I have participated in several CTFs and have learned a lot from them.
